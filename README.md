# CreditCardGenerator

Like the name of the repository says, this project is a Credit Card Generator example. The purpose of this repository is give you an example of how to run an Azure Function Project in a Docker Container. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Introduction
The Credit Card Generator example is based on [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). As an example project, it has only 4 types of credit card mocked so you can run a few test with postman. If you want to add a DataAcces layer to avoid the mock, feel free to do that.

Credit Card Types:
1. Mastercard
2. Visa
3. American Express
4. Cabal

To test with postman you must send through POST method the following json:
```
{
	'TypeId':'2',
	'CustomPrefix':''
}
```
Where TypeId is the credit card type, and CustomPrefix, like his name says, is a custom prefix for the credit card number. If CustomPrefix is empty, the credit card generator will take the predifined prefix for the credit card type.
